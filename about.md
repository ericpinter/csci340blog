title: About This Blog

---

This is a little blog that I'm writing as a part of my Web and DB class.
It's powered by Jekyll (and thus transitively by Ruby) and a light customization of the 'Long Haul' Theme.

I'm a Junior CS (probably also math, but I'm only about 90% sure) major at Hendrix College.
As far as information that people who would read a CS blog would find interesting, my favorite programming language is [Rust](https://Rust-lang.org), which I'm not afraid to evangelize about, to some extent. More Info on that [here](/rust.md)
