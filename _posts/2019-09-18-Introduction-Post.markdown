I've spent the past few days setting up this blog, among other things. I like the concept of Jekyll and Markdown - making automated systems to abstract all of the (usually unnecessary) power of HTML and CSS down to the actual useful bits. I think that the gems necessary to start it all up and the error messages that they give could be streamlined significantly, but overall it's still worth the ease of use of even something like bootstrap. [Installing Ruby][install-ruby] wasn't bad, but I didn't know whether or not the devkit was necessary. As far as CLI goes, I think that setting up a Jekyll site is one of the easier processes to go through, unhelpful errors from ruby excluded. Currently I'm looking forward to:

* Getting into Database Theory and Practice, mostly because it's something I haven't learned about yet
* Starting on our Project and seeing what we can do for setting up a website and for setting up a long-term system for them

On another note, I was surprised to see how many websites actually [use Jekyll][jekyll-showcase]. Even a couple of tech companies!
