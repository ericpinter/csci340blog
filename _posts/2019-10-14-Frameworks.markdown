##Django
I think that Django was an interesting option. It wasn't as streamlined as Flask, but it was a lot more intuitive than Rails or ASP.net. It also seemed decently usable as far as building complicated structures goes. I will definitely look into this for our project, because it seems like a pretty good balance between ease of use and power.

##Flask
I liked the way that Flask did routing and the fact that it's python-based is a big plus. However, it seemed like it was a little bit too lightweight for any significant project and that it filled a niche much closer to Jekyll than any of the other frameworks. I don't think that the mega-lightweight design choices really help much in the long run.

##Express
Express seemed to be pretty similar to Flask, but with a couple more downsides. It seemed like it did even less to set up the default structure for you, and so it seemed like working with it would be significantly more difficult than most of the other frameworks. It also forces you to write most of your code in JS, which I consider to be a massive downside.

##ASP.net
This was an interesting framework because it was not very similar to most of the others we saw. It is a *lot* more complicated. This might let you do really great things for really complicated websites, but it all seems like overkill for anything even close to what we are trying to create for our class projects. I asked Jay why Hendrix uses ASP.net and he said that it's easier for larger projects, but that they only used the web form structure instead of MVC and that that was probably where most of the complexity was coming in.

##Laravel
Laravel seems to be a pretty good choice as far as a framework can do pretty high-power stuff. It also seemed to be a bit more logically laid out than rails was, and I never got the impression that the MVC connections were hidden like I did when working with rails. However, it seems like working with PHP is a really annoying requirement, though maybe it's significantly easier than I'm imagining.
